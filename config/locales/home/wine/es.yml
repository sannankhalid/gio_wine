            The Planeta olive grove extends for 98 hectares in the Capparrina district, a natural oasis of great beauty sloping towards the sea.
            Planeta’s decision to dedicate this land to olives was not random: it was both an ethical and aesthetic choice in order to safeguard the
            landscape and its nature, to make the most of the land and to create employment.

            Vulture is part of a large area in the north of the Basilicata region, dominated by the austere profile of the
            Monte Vulture, a dormant volcano. For centuries the volcanoes were experienced as a source of destruction and death,
            today farmers are compensated for the damage caused by the eruptions of the past by being able to grow vines on land with
            an incomparable wealth of minerals, providing these grapes with a unique complexity.
